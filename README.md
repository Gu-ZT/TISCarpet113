# TISCarpet for Minecraft 1.13.2

------

#### [中文文档](https://github.com/TISUnion/TISCarpet113/blob/TIS-Server/docs/README_cn.md)

A fork of [gnembon's original CarpetMod for 1.13.2](https://github.com/gnembon/carpetmod). Thanks for gnembon's great tool allowing us to deal with bad performance of 1.13+.

Thanks to [Lithium mod](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric) for some of the optimizations

## How to use:
------

- go to download the latest [release](https://github.com/TISUnion/TISCarpet113/releases)
- or go download latest build on [TISJenkins](https://ci.tis.world/) (maybe unstable, but with latest features ofc)
- follow instructions in that zip file to patch vanilla server jar
- read command docs [here](https://github.com/TISUnion/TISCarpet113/blob/TIS-Server/docs/Features.md) or run `/carpet list` to see all options, run `/carpet <featureName>` for details.

## Developing CarpetMod:

See https://github.com/gnembon/carpetmod/blob/master/README.md

Also you need to download TISCM_libs from [here](https://files.catbox.moe/wpe6a5.zip) and unzip it into the project folder, since some of the library providers are down
